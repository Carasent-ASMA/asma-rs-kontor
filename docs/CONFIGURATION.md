# Configuration

Kontor separates invariants from deployment behavior. Rust enforces safety
properties such as one non-terminal session per role slot and uncertainty not
being completion. Names, durations, prompts, skills, profiles, teams, roles,
topology, committees, completion, budgets and runtime routing are versioned data.

That split is the point, not an implementation detail: the workflow being data is
what lets Kontor run research, architecture, UX, QA and operations work without a
core-code branch per work type, and what lets an operator's own conventions become
system behaviour instead of instructions somebody has to remember.

## Where configuration lives

| Location | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<state-root>/kontor.db` | Every versioned specification published through `/v1`: topology specs, role catalogs, work profiles, team templates, advisor profiles, committee templates, completion profiles, Core Team revisions, connector field/workflow specs |
| `<state-root>/runtimes.json` | Runtime family, plane endpoint and per-account provider aliases. Schema generation `4`; generation `3` is refused rather than upgraded, because it can compose the right sessions under misleading names |
| `<state-root>/supervision.yml` | Seat supervision policy (optional; see below) |
| `<state-root>/credentials.json` | The realm's three tier secrets, `0600` |
| `<state-root>/endpoint.json` | Where the realm listens, when not on the default loopback port |
| `<state-root>/provider-homes/` | One credential home per provider account — `CODEX_HOME` for Codex, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for Claude |
| `crates/kontor-mcp/seats/*.json` | Which tier and serve profile one MCP server process runs at |

Everything in the database is published through a preview/apply pair with a
content hash: the apply is compared against the hash the preview returned, so a
specification cannot change between the two.

## Jira-derived backlog and topology names

An epic apply accepts `epic_backlog_code`. Omit it to allocate from the epic
title or set it explicitly when the business namespace differs from initials —
for example `KOP` for “Kontor Operational MVP”. The value is immutable and
case-insensitively unique within that Kontor project. Jira continues to own full
issue keys such as `ASMA-8001`. Epics created before schema v72 remain readable
without a code; reapply them through the preview/apply pair to assign one before
selecting topology v4.

Schema v73 keeps failed create attempts as immutable incident evidence while
allowing a later explicit `link` materialization for the same epic/task and
stable marker. Only create intents retain marker uniqueness, so recovery cannot
emit a second Jira object; the linked key must still be read back and confirmed
before an item code exists.

Operational topology v4 (`01936f5a-1000-7000-8000-000000000001`, revision `4`)
uses the typed `ITEM_CODE` projection and renders centered-dot names. Enable it
in this order:

1. Preview/apply the epic graph and read back its active epic backlog code.
2. Preview/apply Jira materialization and confirm the epic and task issue
   readbacks. A requested or imported key alone is insufficient.
3. Preview/apply the project topology selection to revision 4, which controls
   what new epics inherit.
4. Preview/apply each existing epic's topology upgrade to revision 4.
5. Preview/apply native-name reconciliation for containers or seats that were
   already materialized under revision 1.

The corresponding `/v1` operations are `epics:preview` / `epics:apply`,
`jira:preview` / `jira:apply`, `topology-selection:preview` /
`topology-selection:apply`, `topology:upgrade-preview` /
`topology:upgrade-apply`, and `native-names:preview` / `native-names:apply`.
Revision 1 is never rewritten. Revision 4 refuses placement before a runtime
mutation when the active epic namespace or one unambiguous confirmed Jira
binding is missing.

## Seat supervision

Copy [`config/examples/paseo-supervision.yml`](../config/examples/paseo-supervision.yml)
to `<state-root>/supervision.yml` to publish the intended policy for validation
and inspection. This does **not** enable runtime watchdog behavior today. If the
file is absent, Kontor invents no timeout or watchdog behavior; if it is present,
Kontor reads and validates it but does not act on it yet.

Normal completion is notification-first: the orchestrator yields after dispatch
and the runtime wakes it on completion, error or permission. The watchdog is an
independent bounded observer for a turn that never completes. It may classify a
suspected hang only when both active-turn age and missing-progress evidence are
stale. Recovery reconciles the same seat first; it never duplicates a seat or
cancels running work.

The YAML contains prompt paths and required skill names. Kontor validates and
exposes those references but does not interpret their names. The intended
consumer will have the selected runtime adapter load their contents, keeping
Paseo, AO, Codex and future adapters on the same policy shape without hard-coded
provider behavior; no adapter is dispatched from this policy today.

> **Status:** the policy is read and validated, and has **no consumer yet** —
> nothing currently acts on a configured watchdog. Absent configuration correctly
> invents no behaviour; present configuration also does nothing until
> `KON-OP-21` wires it. This is recorded rather than implied.

## Seat MCP surface

A Kontor MCP server process holds exactly one credential tier and therefore *is*
one seat; running at two authorities means running two servers. Within that tier
a **serve profile** may narrow which tools the server lists and admits — never
widen it, and never beyond what the credential already allows.

| Seat file | Tier | Serve profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `paseo-lead.json` | `admin` | none — the whole vocabulary |
| `worker.json` | `operator` | `worker` — 18 tools: read its work, claim, settle a turn, record a gate verdict, session follow-up, intake, memory search/propose, resolve context |
| `reviewer.json` | `observer` | none — reads only |

Profiles are declared in the registry beside the tier declarations, deliberately
not in the seat file: a free-form tool list in configuration would be a second
authority model that drifts. An unknown profile name refuses to start, and a tool
the profile excludes is refused at call time as well as hidden from the list. See
[`../crates/kontor-mcp/seats/README.md`](../crates/kontor-mcp/seats/README.md).

## Other deployment data

- Profile packs define phases, gates, artifacts, budgets and runtime routing.
  The bundled manifest declares 17 work-profile categories; four ship today
  (`code`, `ux-ui-layout`, `research`, `docs`).
- Team packs define role slots, skills, contexts and handoffs. Role slots carry
  stable ids, so two peers in the same role are explicit rather than duplicate.
- The standard role catalog defines 56 role codes across 9 segments. Seat
  selection is by `role_code`; a free-form role string is not accepted anywhere.
- Account profiles contain non-secret provider-routing metadata and a credential
  reference. No surface — DTO, row, log, export or process argument — has a field
  for a secret value.
- Completion profiles name the integration team, the verdict committee, the
  number of remediation rounds and an optional polling fallback. The seeded
  `operational_default` allows one remediation round.
- Native container and seat naming is a deterministic configurable template.

Changing a prompt, duration, template or specification changes configuration.
Changing a safety invariant requires an architectural decision and code review.
